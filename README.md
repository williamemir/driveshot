# driveshot
Simple chrome extension that takes screenshots and uploads to google drive, only for testing of manifest v3 and chrome extension developing.

In the options you can set the google drive folder id and shared drive id where the screenshots will be saved.

If no folder nor drive id is set, the extension by default will save to the root of the user's drive.
